00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,090
And Mr. Secretary, no need to worry.

162
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,990
We'll need to attach the copy of
the FIR along with the application..

163
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,520
..and they will send us a new monitor.

164
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,030
How long will that take?

165
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,710
Maybe a year. That's it.

166
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,680
Okay. Don't worry.

167
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,510
He was going to look for a room.

168
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,990
Go find yourself a room.

169
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,460
That's great.

170
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,820
He's young blood.

171
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,930
It was just a mistake. Forgive him.

172
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,720
Yes, you two take his side.

173
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,860
Haven't you caused enough
trouble after getting drunk?

174
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,800
What did I do after getting drunk?

175
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,900
- What did I do?
- Don't you remember?

176
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,890
At Vikas' wedding,
during the dance.

177
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,510
..don't you remember what you did?

178
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,690
What did he do?

179
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,130
Whatever I did.

180
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:28,140
It wasn't as bad as
what the Secretary has done.

181
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,990
He gets drunk in two pegs.
Out of his wits practically.

182
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,120
It's a good thing he won't
stay at the office anymore.

183
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:34,870
You're stubborn.

184
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,690
And you Prahlad.

185
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,250
What are you wasting your time on?

186
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,570
Come here. Put the wheat in the sack.

187
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,510
Mr. Secretary hasn't
eaten anything since morning.

188
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,860
What do I do if he hasn't eaten?
Should I spoon-feed him?

189
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,030
Hasn't eaten anything since morning.

190
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,890
And listen,
take the wheat to the flour mill.

191
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:53,060
Tell him to grind it
into a fine powder this time.

192
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,010
Last time it was too coarse.

193
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,980
I heard your computer's been stolen.

194
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,880
Uncle, not the computer.

195
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,850
- Just the monitor.
- What?

196
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,690
- Monitor. Monitor.
- What is it?

197
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,280
Come outside. I'll explain to you.
Come on.

198
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,110
There is a CPU and monitor...

199
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,350
... and the smallest one is called a mouse.

200
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,160
Everything has to be connected together.

201
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,760
That's how it works.

202
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,550
[Indistinct chatter]

203
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:45,220
Abhishek sir.
The Inspector's here.

204
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,600
Manju Devi. Abhishek Tripathi.

205
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,510
So Mr. Tripathi..

206
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:13,070
..how many bottles of beer did you have
that you forgot to lock the door?

207
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,040
Two bottles.

208
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,910
You have a low capacity.

209
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,450
Where were you drinking?

210
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,550
Out here.

211
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,980
Here?

212
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,090
Why were you drinking out here?

213
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,700
The ambience was pleasant,
so I was drinking here...

214
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,950
Then you should have climbed
on top of the water tank.

215
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,690
The ambience is much better up there.

216
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,960
He joined duty four months
ago but never climbed up there.

217
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,190
Why?

218
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,820
It's too tall. Not too comfortable for me.

219
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:58,440
But...the village will look
even better from atop the tank.

220
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,340
Very beautiful.

221
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,720
In fact, if you take a look
at our village from atop the tank...

222
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,940
...you will fall in love with the village.

223
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:03,910
Hear that.

224
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,710
You will fall in love.

225
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,810
You should have climbed on
top of the tank and drank your beer.

226
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,540
Okay, sir. Next time I will
climb on top of the tank and drink beer.

227
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,750
Do you want to ask anything else?

228
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,970
What did you have for snacks?

229
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,880
Potato wedges.

230
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,330
Did you sprinkle some
onions and chillies on top?

231
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,830
Was it the big one or a slim one?

232
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,940
Slim one.

233
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,550
Move aside.

234
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,140
Is this your room?

235
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,230
Yes.

236
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,220
Hold this.

237
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,090
So you have a black colour shoe as well?

238
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,040
You even bought a new iron?

239
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,830
Yes.

240
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,310
Great.

241
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,520
Logical Reasoning for C.A.T.

242
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,060
CAT.

243
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:54,190
Yes, because I am
preparing for MBA as well.

244
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,100
So you want more money in life.

245
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,170
Everyone does.

246
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,500
Yes, everyone does.

247
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:13,960
Anyway, do you drink every day?

248
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,590
No.

249
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,220
Don't be shy.
I am not going to tell your father.

250
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,160
I joined work four months ago.
Yesterday was my first time.

251
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:32,990
What happened?

252
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,520
Where is Pradhan sir?

253
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:41,450
Once I got so drunk that I
forgot to close the door of my house.

254
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,000
Once.

255
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,990
I mean this is common when one is drunk.

256
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,940
It is when you're too drunk.

257
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,230
But it shouldn't happen when
you've drunk only two bottles.

258
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,410
He's got a low capacity.

259
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,870
Otherwise, he drank on an empty stomach.

260
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:59,440
But still...how can he get
drunk with only two bottles of beer?

261
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,420
It's hard to digest.

262
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,900
Anyway, I'll have to believe him.

263
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,310
Mr. Secretary got all his moves right.

264
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,250
What do you mean?

265
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,850
I mean alcohol can also be..

266
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,210
.. a reason to leave the door unlocked.

267
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,110
Mind your own business.

268
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:41,100
Sir, why will the secretary
steal the computer?

269
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,650
Why does anyone steal?

270
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,480
Money.

271
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,190
Why does he need money?

272
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,430
His salary is 20,000.
He even has a motorcycle.

273
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:54,040
I mean...he has money, job...

274
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,320
Then why is he preparing for MBA?

275
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,870
He is ambitious.

276
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,810
Pradhan sir,
aren't you going to say anything?

277
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,930
Think about it yourself, Pradhan sir.

278
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:15,060
A man who hasn't boozed for four months.

279
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:19,630
The computer gets stolen on
the same night when he gets drunk.

280
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,820
Isn't this a foolproof story.

281
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:27,760
I mean...he was drunk
and forgot to lock the door.

282
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,170
Anyone will believe him.

283
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,510
Inspector, what are you saying?

284
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,540
Fine, you tell me.

285
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,960
Why did he get drunk
on the night of the theft?

286
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,460
I don't know why.

287
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,090
No, tell me.

288
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:47,690
Let's ask the man who
got drunk why he got drunk.

289
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,210
What do you mean by why?
Because I wanted to.

290
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,220
Why not in the last four months?

291
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,500
And why last night?

292
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,180
Wait a minute.
What do you guys want to imply?

293
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:17,440
Secretary sir, the inspector
says that you helped steal the computer.

294
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:21,200
Alcohol was just an
excuse to let it get stolen.

295
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,060
Are you out of your mind?

296
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:28,880
Why did you drink alcohol last night?

297
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,790
Because I was sulking.

298
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,520
Why were you sulking?

299
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,910
What do mean by why?
Why does anyone sulk?

300
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,460
I was sulking, that's it.

301
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:43,380
Up.

302
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,080
See Pradhan sir, no answer.

303
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,230
He has no answer.

304
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:58,890
Guilty conscious pricks the mind...

305
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,200
I was sulking because I follow
the same routine every day.

306
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,740
Wake up in the morning,
work all day, study at night.

307
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,540
The villagers complain all day, then
there's the electricity problem at night.

308
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,900
I am bored.

309
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,030
And yesterday was Friday night.

310
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,330
So what?

311
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:16,020
Every sixth day of the week is...

312
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,330
It's called a weekend.
People party on the weekend.

313
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,440
And what was I doing?
Peeling bottle gourd.

314
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,260
There is not a single guy
around to talk to after work hours.

315
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,310
Everyone falls asleep at 7 o'clock.

316
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,570
Pradhan sir gets busy
with his personal life.

317
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,230
This man has his own social life.

318
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,270
He just got married.
Who do I talk to?

319
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,700
How long can I talk on the phone?

320
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,070
I have no friend, no family.
No social life.

321
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:42,340
What else can a lonely
man do other than booze?

322
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,610
I feel least attached to this village.
It's pathetic.

323
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,560
I was in a bad mood. And got drunk.

324
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,090
Do you want to arrest me?
Go ahead. Arrest me.

325
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,790
Where are your handcuffs me?
Go ahead. Arrest me.

326
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,260
Arrest me. Put me in the jail.

327
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,180
At least there will be
something interesting in my life.

328
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,440
Pradhan sir, he's bluffing.

329
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,560
Just say the word.

330
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:17,780
I'll take him down to the Police
Station and teach him a proper lesson.

331
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:22,060
Inspector...he can be
careless but not a thief.

332
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,520
I know a man when I see one.
Now leave.

333
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,620
What are you staring at? Let's go.

334
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,310
Hello. Vikas.

335
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,940
Check whether the
Secretary has eaten or not?

336
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,810
Yes, sir.

337
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,430
What did he say?

338
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,700
- He says he's not in the mood.
- What?

339
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,670
He says he's not in the mood.

340
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,840
Shall I make a few
more pieces of bread?

341
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,390
Pradhan sir.

342
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:43,130
Tell me something, is Saturday
considered as a weekend or not?

343
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,680
Tell me.

344
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:55,520
We never use spoon
for having food.

345
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,400
I can drink beer in one gulp.

346
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,440
In one gulp whole beer!

347
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,600
Abhishek sir, can I say something?

348
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,940
We've made a WhatsApp group.

349
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:14,430
Whenever we want to drink, we just say hi.

350
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,640
I am thinking of adding
you to the group as well.

351
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,270
And whenever you want to...

352
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,090
Do you know what "Hi" means?

353
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,270
High...

354
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,450
- Hi...
- Come soon.

355
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:27,080
Take some more.

356
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:32,390
Mr. Secretary,
I am really offended by what you said.

357
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:33,940
What?

358
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:38,680
How can you say you have
no family or friends here?

359
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:41,410
What do you think they are?
This huge man, and him...

360
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,760
Don't you think of us as friends?

361
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,410
That's not it, Pradhan sir.

362
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,910
- Then what is it?
- You think we're not your family.

363
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:52,190
I checked the monitor prices.
The best ones cost 5000 rupees.

364
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,520
I'll order one for us.

365
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,560
Why will you bear all the expenses?

366
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,510
- We'll pay too.
- No.

367
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,400
Of course, we'll all chip in 1000 rupees.

368
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,640
But that's only 4000 rupees.

369
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,430
So what. I'll show
you how to make it 5000.

370
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,210
- Show us. How?
- Shall I?

371
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,500
Tell Rinky's mom to pay 1000.

372
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,300
She's the Pradhan as well.

373
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,060
Great idea. Look he laughed.

374
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,110
Give me a papadum.

375
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,830
Listen, no need to look for another place.

376
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,660
You can stay here.

377
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,770
No one's going to
ask as long as I am here.

378
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,160
See...that's more like it.

379
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,160
See...let's take a selfie together.

380
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:35,870
- Selfie.
- Take a selfie.

381
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:38,460
Hold your bottles. Lets take a nice selfie.

382
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,690
You take one.

383
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:43,200
You also keep one.

384
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,910
You guys drink.
I've never touched that thing.

385
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:50,510
Beer is not my thing.
I've never touched beer.

386
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:54,970
These three are drinking,
and I am just the guy taking the selfie.

387
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,350
See...

388
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,970
Smile.

389
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,100
Say Selfie.

390
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:04,270
Say it aloud Selfie.

391
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:43,900
I thought it was a television. Sorry.
