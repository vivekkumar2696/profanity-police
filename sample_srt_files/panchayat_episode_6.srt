1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,000
Face down.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,760
Lower. Lower.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,680
That's too low.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,470
Smile.

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,490
More. More...

6
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:18,990
Great.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,760
Very good. One more.

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,590
Great.

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,690
Show me how it looks.

10
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,030
Take a look.

11
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,340
First one's better.

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,810
Okay fine, I'll make that one.

13
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,410
Are you applying for
the bank clerk's job?

14
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,460
It's for the CAT exam.

15
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,170
Common exam for MBA.

16
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,780
I see... Good.

17
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,770
- You can collect it tomorrow at 11 am.
- I'm not rufusing you to sit.

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,990
What do you want to do about it asshole?

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,820
I am being so polite
and yet you don't understand.

20
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:51,940
No asshole, I don't.

21
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,020
Stop abusing me.

22
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,500
Don't point fingers at me.

23
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,040
If you want to sit then do so properly.

24
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,910
I've no objection. But if
you want to sit, then do it properly.

25
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,790
Are you going to teach
me how to sit on a motorcycle?

26
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,360
- What happened?
- Come, sir.

27
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,930
These guys were sitting
on your motorcycle.

28
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,560
I only said the bike's
parked on a single stand.

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,340
If you put too much weight on it,
it will topple.

30
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,790
If you want to sit,
park the bike on the double stand first.

31
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:10,760
- And he got furious.
- I see...

32
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,160
If we want to sit on
someone's motorcycle..

33
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,420
..we'll have to park it on the
double stand first.

34
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,440
- Then don't sit.
- Don't sit.

35
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,360
Lower your voice, understand.

36
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,620
You sat on my bike
and now you're misbehaving.

37
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,870
What did you say?

38
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,150
You're calling me mannerless?

39
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,710
What else should I call you?

40
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,060
Wait here, son. Give me 10 minutes.

41
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,070
I will show you what
misbehaving means. Wait.

42
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,960
You don't know what you said.

43
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,560
Should we call Pradhan sir?

44
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,470
Brother Mukesh. This is Bablu.

45
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,330
Send some boys to
Sunil's shop right now.

46
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,100
Immediately.

47
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,300
Wait just 10 minutes. I'll show you.

48
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,200
Why should I wait 10 minutes?
Don't I have anything better to do?

49
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,310
- Move.
- What?

50
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,500
I said move.

51
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,150
Hop on, Vikas.

52
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,190
Brother Sunil, what time will he
come tomorrow to collect his pictures?

53
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,660
11 o'clock.

54
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,900
See you tomorrow at 11 o'clock son,
I'll show you misbehaving.

55
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,990
What's the matter now? Are you scared
of us now? Is that all the zing you had?

56
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,670
We're not scared.

57
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,070
- Get lost.
- I said stop abusing.

58
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,330
Get lost.

59
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,730
I said get lost.

60
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:04,830
- You get lost.
- Get lost.

61
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:05,890
- You get lost.
- Get lost.

62
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,850
You get lost.

63
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,670
Come on. Hit me. Hit me.

64
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,910
- Hit me. Come.
- Vikas, let's go.

65
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,550
Wait just 10 minutes.
Why are you running now assholes?

66
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,580
- You get lost.
- Get lost.

67
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,330
- You get lost. - See you tomorrow
at 11 o'clock son. I'll show you.

68
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,160
Are you crazy, Vikas? Why are
you getting involved in these things?

69
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,850
This is about our self-respect, sir.

70
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,770
They are messing with you.

71
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,460
Let's not lock horn with these people.

72
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,870
Let's go there tomorrow at
11 o'clock and teach them a lesson.

73
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,930
- Who are you calling?
- Pradhan sir.

74
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,760
Are you mad? Let's not make
thing worse than they already are.

75
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,480
They openly threatened us, sir.
We must take some action.

76
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,940
There is no need to take any action.

77
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,130
Why is your ego hurt so much?

78
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,370
- Are you some don?
- No, I am not a don.

79
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,610
But I don't know why you are so scared?

80
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,430
I am not scared.

81
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,280
Then what is it, sir?

82
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,040
Exams are around the corner.

83
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,780
Should I focus on my studies
or get into unnecessary fights.

84
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,190
Why should I take this stress?

85
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,920
You don't need to take any stress.

86
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,500
Pradhan sir will handle everything.

87
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,200
I don't want to get involved
in these things. Don't you get it?

88
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,030
What if you go there
tomorrow at 11 o'clock..

89
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,190
..and they beat the lights out of you?

90
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,330
What will you do then?

91
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,800
I'll think of something.
I'll avoid them.

92
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,240
In fact, I won't go at 11 o'clock.

93
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,060
- I'll go at 2 o'clock instead.
- Great sir.

94
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,240
You go at 2 o'clock. Better.
Prepare for your MBA. Even better.

95
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,830
But sir..

96
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,240
..there's something called self-respect.

97
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,910
People who work as a secretary
don't have any self-respect.

98
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:40,960
My pictures, please.

99
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,070
That was a good idea.

100
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,570
Just give me my pictures.

101
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,400
The pictures...

102
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,610
What?

103
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:59,140
You see, Bablu and
Dablu hail from my village.

104
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,710
How does that make any difference?

105
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,300
Oh, it does.

106
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,930
Since they are from my village
and you had a tiff with them...

107
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,420
...so that means you
had a tiff with me as well.

108
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,170
What nonsense is this?

109
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,320
You don't get it.

110
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,380
In this battle, I am on their side.
That's what I am saying.

111
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,530
Since this concerns my village,
I can't be a traitor.

112
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,200
What nonsense is this?
Just give me my photo.

113
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,550
You were supposed to show
up at 11 o'clock, but you didn't...

114
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:27,020
...so on Bablu and Dablu's
orders I had to delete the photos.

115
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,450
To hell with you and those Bablu-Dablu.

116
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,500
There are other places in Fakauli Market.
I'll get my picture taken there.

117
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,150
As you wish.

118
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,780
Listen...

119
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,570
You'll be in the market, won't you?

120
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,140
Bablu-Dablu said that I should
inform them when you get here.

121
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,430
Will you be staying
in the market or leaving?

122
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,050
Listen... Tell me. Listen!

123
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,280
I guess he's running.

124
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,980
Did you get your photos?

125
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,600
Bring white bedsheets tomorrow
while coming to office.

126
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,540
White bedsheets for what?

127
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,390
As a background.

128
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,190
I'll get my picture taken
in the office tomorrow.

129
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,490
In the office?

130
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,650
Those rascals got my pictures deleted.

131
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,140
Take my advice and let's tell
Pradhan sir. He will handle everything.

132
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,580
If your blood still isn't boiling,
then your blood thinner than water.

133
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,540
Hello.

134
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,310
Hello.

135
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,090
Asshole...
Talk to him.

136
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,020
Who is this?

137
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,020
I head that you came to
collect your photos at 2 o'clock.

138
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,360
Why are you bothering me?
What do you want?

139
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,870
We were thinking that we
show you what misbehaviour is.

140
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,700
You already did.
What else do you want to show now?

141
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,690
That was not a proper
demonstration, asshole.

142
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,770
Come to Fakauli Market again,
and we'll show you properly.

143
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,030
You are unbelievable. I am not saying
anything and you're taking this too far.

144
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,770
Can you even lay a
finger on me even if I do?

145
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,620
Mind your tongue.

146
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:50,510
Or else...will you come
down to Fakauli and beat us?

147
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,770
Yes, I will.

148
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,450
Then come there. We are waiting for you.

149
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,590
What's the matter?
Don't have the courage?

150
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,250
Are you shit scared?

151
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:03,970
I did hear something.

152
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,570
How long do you think
you can hide in Phulera?

153
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,580
Someday you'll have
to come to Fakauli Market.

154
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,790
Who do you think you are?

155
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,120
Who do you think you are?

156
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,090
Tell me when and where.

157
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,200
I see...

158
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,110
You know what,
come to the ground behind Fakauli market.

159
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,680
3 o'clock. I'll show you.

160
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,050
I'll make you dance nude,
or else my name isn't Abhishek.

161
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,130
Now you're saying too much.

162
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,090
Come, son. We'll show you.

163
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,200
Get lost.

164
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,730
Yes, I will handle it.

165
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,190
- Right, Prahlad.
- Exactly. We're not scared of anyone.

166
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,890
Didn't I tell you, sir?

167
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,160
Will we need more men?

168
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,200
I'll carry a rifle with me.
We won't need anyone else.

169
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,360
Rifle?

170
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,730
Shall we take an axe as well?

171
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,030
No, Rifle will be a bit too much.

172
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:12,070
We can opt for something else.
Like a belt, stick...

173
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,970
You know what,
do you have a leather jacket.

174
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,330
Yes, I do.

175
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,690
Great. Then wear that
and come see me at 2:30.

176
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,940
Leather jackets absorb
most of the beatings.

177
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,390
I'll clean my rifle.

178
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,980
Pradhan sir, I think a couple
of bullets will do the job.

179
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,490
This is too much.

180
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,790
Pradhan sir, give the rifle to me.
I'll carry it.

181
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,350
He's taking a long time.
Call him up.

182
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,080
Where are these two?

183
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,820
Don't know. They were right behind us.

184
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,170
Either they are crazy or very brave.

185
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,820
- They showed up all alone.
- Asshole.

186
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,220
Let's take a look.

187
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,660
Wait a minute.
More of our men are coming.

188
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,510
Why are you calling backup now?

189
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,100
Who is he calling?

190
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,480
Doesn't matter even if he's
calling Rambo. We'll deal with him.

191
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,510
Yes, let him call anyone.

192
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,430
Stupid

193
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,260
Mr. Secretary.

194
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,160
- Hello.
- Speaker. Speaker.

195
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:40,860
Hello.

196
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,170
Pradhan sir, where are you?

197
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,690
Don't worry, we're on the way.

198
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:48,200
The bike's got a flat tire.
So Prahlad is pushing it.

199
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,550
It's just a flat tire, Pradhan sir.
It's not like you've run out of petrol.

200
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,670
Mr. Secretary,
the flat tire was due to a nail.

201
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,980
If we ride the bike now,
it will tear the tube.

202
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,980
And then it will become a costly affair
because we'll have to change the tube.

203
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,570
Pradhan sir, come soon.
They are already here.

204
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:06,640
They are waiting for us.

205
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,990
There's still five minutes left to 3 pm.

206
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,360
I didn't know they are so punctual.
They are here now. Come soon.

207
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,740
What assholes?

208
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,540
So eager to fight. Give me rifle.

209
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,930
- Hop on. Hop on.
- Coming, Secretary sir.

210
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,080
We'll teach those assholes...

211
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,030
Yes, yes...
They are coming.

212
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:22,970
How much time?

213
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,600
They are coming.

214
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,720
Brother Bablu, let's beat
the crap out of them and go home.

215
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,380
You know what, give me your belt.

216
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,200
My pant is loose, use your own.

217
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,340
My belt's made of rexine.
It won't hurt too much.

218
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,350
I spent a fortune on this belt.
Give it to me.

219
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,490
Give me your belt them.
You know my pants are loose.

220
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,530
Hurry up.

221
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,870
Asshole, you have a small waist. Takes
less than a minute to take off your belt.

222
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,570
Wear this belt first otherwise
your pants will come down.

223
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,570
Brother, wait...

224
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,070
There are some rules in a fight.

225
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,460
At least let them come.

226
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,860
Surround them. Surround them.

227
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,230
- Brother.
- Surround them.

228
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,120
- Some more man is coming.
- You'll make me dance nude.

229
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,480
Now I'll make you dance nude.

230
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,790
What are you guys doing?

231
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,170
Take your clothes off.

232
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,200
Am I talking to you?
Mind your tongue.

233
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,300
- I am being polite.
- I am talking to him. Show some manners.

234
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,230
Mr. Manners take your clothes off...

235
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,450
...or else I'll beat you
to a pulp with this belt.

236
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,210
Some of our men are coming.
Let them get here.

237
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,910
Son...
We're explaining you politely.

238
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,250
You have only one choice.

239
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,020
Take your clothes off and dance.

240
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,280
And leave quietly. Understand.

241
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,380
You're a hot-headed man.

242
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,240
- Beat them.
- You're wasting time talking to them.

243
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,440
- Beat them. Beat them.
- Remove it fast..

244
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,650
- What are you doing?
- This is a piece of cloth as well.

245
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,870
No, no...

246
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,990
- Beat them.
- Start now.

247
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,000
Why is he standing quietly?
Start stripping, son.

248
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,030
Take your clothes.

249
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,940
I didn't mean it when I said I'll
make you dance nude. No one does that.

250
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,350
A man says things in a fit of rage,
but you don't need to take it seriously.

251
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,340
Start stripping or else I will
start ripping you off. Take it off.

252
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,510
- Give him a hand. Come on.
- No, I'll do it myself.

253
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,310
Look at him,
taking his watch and belt off.

254
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,170
- No, no,
- Brother...

255
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,520
Do I need to tell you separately?

256
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,500
Brother Bablu, shall we play
a song while making the dance.

257
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,080
Play "KajraRe"

258
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,540
Great choice.

259
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,980
Your phones keep ringing off the hook.

260
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,250
Yes, Pradhan sir, where are you?

261
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,080
We're already here.

262
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,040
Where? We're right here.

263
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,790
We're standing next to the temple.

264
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,690
Take a right from the temple
and come to the ground at the back.

265
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,380
Tell them to take a left, that's
a shortcut. Tell them to hurry up.

266
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,330
Take a left, that's a shortcut. Come
soon, they are making me strip dance.

267
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,270
Strip dance?
Why are they making you strip?

268
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,320
- I don't know. Come soon.
- Let's go.

269
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,050
Don't take your clothes off.

270
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,820
- They'll take a video and spread it.
- Continue.

271
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,100
We're taking it off.
We're taking it off.

272
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,610
Don't talk too much.

273
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,520
Did you get it? Come on.

274
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,950
You guys can't escape now.

275
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,570
Wear them. Wear your clothes.

276
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,480
Pradhan sir,
they are making us strip our clothes.

277
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,410
Wait. Move back.

278
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,370
Move back.

279
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,690
I'll shoot you through your ass.

280
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,020
Are you shit scared now?
Come ahead now.

281
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:23,000
Brother Bablu,
I think that gun's a fake.

282
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,820
It has no bolt. The barrel's narrow.

283
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,810
It's only good for shooting birds.

284
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,810
Listen, green t-shirt,
this is a real gun.

285
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,010
Balls green t-shirt.

286
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,800
- If it's real, then shoot.
- Yes, shoot.

287
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,520
- Come on shoot.
- Shoot. Shoot.

288
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,200
Yes, shoot.

289
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,850
- Shoot.
- Shoot.

290
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,090
I'll make you two take
off your underwear as well.

291
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,920
Brother...

292
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,880
Who is Bablu?

293
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,480
- I am Bablu.
- You are Bablu.

294
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,870
- What is your father's name?
- Jagmohan.

295
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,000
And which village?

296
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,280
Why? Do you want to make my Aadhar card?

297
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:56,580
No son, I'll teach
you a lesson with one slap.

298
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,650
The old man has a death wish.

299
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,240
Uncle, don't mess with
young boys at this age.

300
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:04,640
Otherwise I will hit you also.

301
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,490
Understand.
Move aside.

302
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,690
Uncle's been yapping for a long time.

303
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,400
What are you looking at?

304
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:26,310
- Help uncle stand up.
- Yeah, time for his funeral.

305
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:27,840
What are you staring at?

306
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,660
You can't even lay a finger on us.

307
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,740
- He's Rambo, isn't he?
- Really!

308
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,480
What are you staring at?

309
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,970
Look at him...

310
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,240
And with a fake gun...

311
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,180
He's a real asshole.

312
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,200
- Hey!
- Move back.

313
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,120
I'll show you how
to kill with a fake gun.

314
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,820
He'll die.

315
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,950
- Rascals!
- Hit him. Hit him.

316
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,630
Take your belt out, brother Bablu.
What the fuck are you doing?

317
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,980
He is gone crazy.

318
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,980
Come on, take your belt out.
Take it out.

319
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,400
Come on.

320
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,310
Beat him. Beat him.

321
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,210
You go.

322
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,190
Hey, don't hit.

323
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,730
Someone save brother Bablu.

324
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,880
Are you crazy?
He's lost his mind.

325
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,780
- I will hit you.
- Run...!

326
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,200
Run! Trying to bully us.

327
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,010
Trying to bully us.

328
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,760
- Trying to bully us.
- Run!

329
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,150
The guy at the back. Get him.

330
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,380
You'll hit me with a brick.

331
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:42,870
Wait there.

332
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,500
Come here. Come here.

333
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,170
Hit them!

334
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,360
- I will hit you with the belt.
- Stop!

335
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,240
Are you mad?

336
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:56,220
- I will die.
- Stop yelling from here. Go help him.

337
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,270
- He's doing fine.
- Listen, listen.

338
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,400
I will hit you.
How dare you hit Pradhan sir?

339
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,540
- Shall I hit?
- Bablu, hit him.

340
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,020
- Shall I hit?
- No, no, don't hit me.

341
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,960
- Trying to bully us.
- No, no, no...

342
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,570
- Trying to bully us.
- No, no, no...

343
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,080
How dare you hit?

344
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,970
How dare you hit Pradhan sir?

345
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,120
Sorry, it was a mistake. Handle him.

346
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,810
To hell with CAT, I will break his...

347
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,560
No, no... Stop!

348
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,890
- Leave me.
- You will kill him.

349
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,810
- You will make us strip.
- Leave him.

350
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,060
- You will make us strip.
- Leave him.

351
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,440
Don't let him go. He's an animal.

352
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,580
Who did you call an animal?

353
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,730
- Who did you call an animal?
- Go from here.

354
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,160
- Let them go.
- These boys have no future, sir.

355
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,980
Let them go.

356
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,380
He's lost it.

357
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,540
Get lost.

358
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,390
Leave him.

359
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,330
Take your glasses.

360
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,190
We told you not to sit on the bike!
And that hurt his ego.

361
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,330
It was parked on a single stand.

362
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,770
If you had fallen,
you would've broken a tooth.

363
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:58,350
You think I am an asshole.
Never sat on a bike before.

364
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,530
- How could I fall?
- How? I'll show you how.

365
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,680
I'll show this asshole
how he could've fallen.

366
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,730
- Let it be.
- I'll show you how.

367
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,620
- No, let me show him.
- You'll break a bone.

368
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,070
He's a mad man.

369
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,880
Complete animal.

370
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,510
Get lost you guys before
he gets up. Come on.

371
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,110
Get lost.

372
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,840
Fake gun!

373
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,140
Assholes...

374
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,840
What is that red oozing
from his forehead?

375
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,310
You said you'll get your
picture taken someplace else.

376
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:49,160
I mean it's a good thing you came here.

377
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,010
This is your shop too.

378
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,460
Look down.

379
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,900
I mean there's no pressure.

380
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,190
You can look down if you want to,
otherwise, it's okay.

381
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,690
What's wrong?
Why are you behaving like this?

382
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,880
No, it's okay.

383
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,590
Forgive me for deleting your picture.

384
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,590
Fine, now take my picture.

385
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,000
First, forgive me.

386
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,700
- Come on...
- No, please. I'm clicking your picture.

387
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,370
I'm clicking.

388
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,110
Smile.
