1
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,920
That plastic chair which you sit on..

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,540
If you sit on it too long,
your backside heats up.

3
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,430
But the thing with
cushioned seats is..

4
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,180
You want to sit for an hour..

5
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,120
..but you don't want to
get up for a couple of hours.

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,890
It's great for your studies as well.

7
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,270
- Great..
- Mr. Secretary, new chair, huh.

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,770
Yes, the plastic chairs are not too
comfortable to sit on for too long.

9
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,160
Okay.

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,020
And I've to study as well.

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,630
Great. Great.

12
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,000
Okay.

13
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,600
This one's got wheels as well.

14
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,510
Sir, your chair doesn't
have wheels, does it?

15
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,410
This is too high.

16
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:06,160
- Adjust it.
- How do I adjust the height?

17
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,360
The button must be
somewhere down there.

18
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,410
Okay.

19
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,230
That's too low.

20
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,830
Yes. Now, this is perfect.

21
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:17,280
This one's got wheels too.
Check if they are working properly.

22
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,150
Great.

23
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:26,520
Sir, take the plastic off.
Doesn't look nice at all.

24
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,360
No, no, I won't take the plastic off.

25
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,360
It's so dusty around here.
The chair will get dirty in a week.

26
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,280
You're right.

27
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,450
How do bend backwards?

28
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,710
You look like some big boss.

29
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,710
Let's get some work done now,
shall we?

30
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,690
Yes.

31
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,050
Pradhan Sir.

32
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,680
Parmeshwar. What happened?
Anything wrong.

33
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,350
I needed one small favour.

34
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,200
What do I tell you, Pradhan sir?

35
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,580
Don't drink water after you've had tea
or else you will catch a cold.

36
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,300
I already did now.

37
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,830
Doesn't matter.

38
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,190
The wedding is tomorrow..

39
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,320
..and today they say
that the groom wants..

40
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,690
..a separate room for waiting.

41
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:11,880
Why?

42
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,080
What is his problem in waiting at the
school with the rest of the guests?

43
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,400
He's being stubborn, what else?

44
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,590
Stubborn.

45
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,140
You had to choose a stubborn
son-in-law for yourself.

46
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,850
It didn't say on his face.

47
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,550
Don't worry, I'll think of something.

48
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,890
Who does he think he is?

49
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,000
- Secretary.
- Yes, sir.

50
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,200
You know Parmeshwar.

51
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:44,870
Parmeshwar who?

52
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:48,060
His daughter's getting
married tomorrow.

53
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,040
Yes.

54
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,680
He sitting right
here and looks stressed.

55
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,020
The groom's demanding
a separate room to stay.

56
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,480
He won't stay with
the rest of the guests.

57
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,640
He's very stressed how
to find a room in one day.

58
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,900
So I wondering if you
could adjust for one day..

59
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,870
- One day..
- Just one day, isn't it?

60
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:07,820
If you could adjust for a day,
that would be great.

61
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,920
And I've said that he can stay
at the Panchayat office for a day.

62
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,490
Hello.

63
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,090
Hello.

64
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,480
Hello..

65
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,470
No network? Huh..

66
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,540
Check for network. Yes.

67
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,290
- Check for network.
- There's just one bar.

68
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:28,250
- Try there..
- Yes. It came.

69
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,950
Hello. Hello.

70
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:30,950
Why don't you make
him stay someplace else..

71
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,200
..otherwise it will
become uncomfortable for me.

72
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,730
I've to study at night.

73
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,310
I'll get disturbed.

74
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,840
He's very stressed.
Where else can we let him stay?

75
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,030
Please, sir.

76
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,710
He's saying please.

77
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,240
Doesn't matter. I understand.

78
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,070
Thank you, sir.

79
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,470
Did he say no?

80
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,970
He didn't say no.

81
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,070
He said he has a problem.

82
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,570
Well then, what should I do?

83
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,670
Well then..

84
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,240
Let's make some other arrangement.

85
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:16,160
Don't feel bad,
but can I say something?

86
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,090
Go ahead. Why would I feel bad?

87
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,220
You're losing your control
over the Panchayat office now.

88
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,320
What?

89
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,020
And all this because
of that cushioned chair.

90
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,090
Anyone who sits on it
thinks of himself as the boss.

91
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,210
No, that's not it.

92
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,870
But it looks like this, sir.

93
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,580
Why else would a secretary
refuse to follow the Pradhan's order?

94
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,670
Goodbye.

95
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:12,490
[Indistinct chatter]

96
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:17,160
[Indistinct chatter]

97
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,060
[Indistinct chatter]

98
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:27,020
[Indistinct chatter]

99
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,760
[Indistinct chatter]

100
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,760
Let this be.

101
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,000
What's wrong with Pradhan sir?

102
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,580
Nothing is wrong with him, sir.

103
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,640
Pradhan sir is our leader of sorts.

104
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,490
He helps people in need
to keep his influence..

105
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,170
Then let him work himself for that.

106
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,180
Why did he have to tell that
Parmeshwar that I've no work..

107
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,730
..and can get this job done.

108
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,190
You see, sir, in villages..

109
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,250
..whenever there is a wedding,
function, or funeral..

110
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,340
..everyone comes
together to lend a hand.

111
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,310
Look at me for instance,
I am helping out too.

112
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,280
This is the tradition,
the culture of the village.

113
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,880
You're free to follow their tradition.

114
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,330
I am not their relative
to work for them.

115
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:14,550
Bantu, keep an eye on the cook.
He's a thief.

116
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,220
Starts eating the
food while making them.

117
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,390
I apologise for this inconvenience,
Mr. Secretary.

118
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:26,120
It's not a problem, Mr. Parmeshwar.

119
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,650
- Vikas.
- Yes.

120
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,430
Once you're done here..

121
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,640
- ..go check on the arrangements
at the school. - Okay.

122
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,600
- The quilts have to be laid out. Okay?
- Okay.

123
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,500
You're free too, aren't you?

124
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:45,690
No, he has to go to Fakauli market.

125
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,720
Are you going now?

126
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,700
I was just leaving.

127
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,770
Is it an emergency?

128
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,000
Yes, there is.

129
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,040
There is an emergency.

130
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,490
He has to sell this emergency light.

131
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,850
So it's a bit of an emergency.

132
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,640
Since solar light's
been installed outside..

133
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,430
..there is no need
for two emergency lights.

134
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,960
So I'll sell one.

135
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,340
He's a moody guy.
Sells anything when he wants to.

136
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,540
- Vikas, get my helmet.
- Yes.

137
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,870
Here you go, sir.

138
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,700
Fakauli Market?

139
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,890
Couldn't you think of a better excuse?

140
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,790
What will I do in Fakauli market now?

141
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,520
Sir, I saved you from work.

142
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,330
You should be thanking me for this,
but instead, you're yelling at me.

143
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,710
I see, saved me from work.

144
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,460
By giving me this other stupid job.

145
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,740
Oh, yes..

146
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,400
I have an idea, sir.

147
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,820
Why don't you go to the
garden outside the village?

148
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,330
You can rest there for
the rest of the afternoon.

149
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,510
And come back when the sun sets,
and the guests arrive.

150
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,940
If you stay here, they will
ask you to do something or other.

151
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,130
Yeah, right..

152
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,560
You know what,
get my Verbal Ability book.

153
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,820
Which book?

154
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,890
The blue book that's inside.
Go get it.

155
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,930
Verbal Ability. Verbal Ability.

156
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,160
Verbal Ability. Verbal Ability.

157
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,230
Verbal Ability. Verbal Ability..

158
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,690
Verbal Ability.

159
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,390
Where are you taking this book?

160
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,390
Secretary sir asked for it.

161
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,140
But he's on his way to the market.

162
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,260
Why does he need a book there?

163
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,980
He wants to sell this too.

164
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,810
Just one?

165
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,330
No. He's going to sell all of them.

166
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,980
He's going to sell these books too.

167
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,070
But why is he selling the books?

168
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,410
Don't know.

169
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,440
He was saying that these
books are of not much use.

170
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,700
That's why?

171
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,400
- I see.
- Yes.

172
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,420
- Can I leave, uncle?
- Yes, go.

173
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,900
Go.

174
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,140
He really is a moody guy.

175
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,350
Sells anything he wants.

176
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,650
Yeah, Bantu. What's wrong?

177
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,860
What? We've run out
of clarified butter?

178
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,400
Then send someone to
Fakauli market and get more.

179
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,420
Wait a minute.

180
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,470
Mr. Secretary, wait.

181
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,580
- What is it now?
- May he wants something.

182
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,200
Are you blind? Move.

183
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,240
Mr. Secretary, you're going
to Fakauli market, aren't you?

184
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,310
Yes.

185
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,690
I need a small favour.

186
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,140
Get a 15-litre canister of clarified
butter from Babloo Sahu's shop.

187
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,890
- He'll charge it to my account.
- No, it's not the money.

188
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,560
- How can I carry 15-litre alone?
- Yes, there's no place.

189
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,450
No, no, it's got a handle.

190
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,540
You can hang it over here.

191
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,910
But I've already hung
the emergency light over here.

192
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,860
But you're going to sell that,
aren't you?

193
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:23,570
You can hang the canister
once there's place.

194
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,040
Okay.

195
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,650
Yes, hello. Anything else?

196
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,190
Wok?

197
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,950
Where..

198
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:38,160
No, no. Later.

199
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,580
Don't bring the canister here.

200
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,340
Take it to my home.

201
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,090
There are little things around
the house that need to be done.

202
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,480
Did you get it?

203
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,800
Hurry up.

204
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,190
Lay the quilts here.

205
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:56,580

Where is the cook?

210
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,990
Where is the cook?

211
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,390
Where is the cook?
I've to give this clarified butter.

212
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,620
- Look, Vikas!
- Yes.

213
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,780
Give separate boxes
to the guests and villagers.

214
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,850
Okay.

215
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,690
Seven sweets for the guests,
and only five for the villagers.

216
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:32,570
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

217
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,630
Use this.

218
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,640
Keep swatting the flies, will you?

219
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,730
No. Go serve it to them.

220
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,970
Mr. Secretary is here too.

221
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,220
Come.

222
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,270
You did a great job.

223
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,500
Keep it there. Okay.

224
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,520
Careful.

225
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,960
Take the clarified butter.

226
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,790
Very good, Mr. Secretary. Amazing.

227
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:54,890
What? Are you tired?

228
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,300
Did you sell the emergency light?

229
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,830
Not really? He wasn't
offering a good price for it.

230
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,110
Give me the office keys.

231
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,410
You're going to the office,
aren't you?

232
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,480
I need a small favour.

233
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,870
[regional folk song]

234
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,730
Sir, I was thinking..

235
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:24,810
..one tube light on this side,
one on this side and one here.

236
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:27,490
It will make you feel like you're
entering a house of tube lights.

237
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,960
Put it.

238
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:33,130
Sir, do I use white
tube lights or green.

239
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,290
Use whatever you like. Use green.

240
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,530
Don't you think white
will look better?

241
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,910
Fine, I'll use the green ones.

242
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,410
I guess you had the green
ones on your mind for a long time.

243
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,790
One more thing, sir.

244
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:50,560
The sequence of the series
light should be blinking..

245
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,910
..or doesn't have to be
like an on-off-on-off sequence.

246
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:56,080
Will you do anything on your own?
Should I install the lights?

247
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,540
Put it however you want it.
This is not my sister's wedding.

248
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,970
Just put it on. Any way you want it.

249
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,310
I'll let it blink then.

250
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,740
Didn't you hear I said blinking?

251
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,690
No one understands the latest trend.

252
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,730
Which number is he calling from now?

253
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,990
- Hello.
- Mr. Secretary.

254
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,600
Parmeshwar, speaking.

255
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,180
I needed one small favour.

256
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,570
Not, again!

257
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,770
- Prahlad.
- Yes.

258
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:10,330
Do you believe that sitting on the
cushioned chair makes a man powerful?

259
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,200
Honestly, sir, I don't think the
secretary thinks anything like that.

260
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:16,780
I know.

261
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,390
But people do.

262
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,730
That they do.

263
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:23,730
I have an idea. Why don't
you buy a chair for yourself?

264
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,270
What good will that do?

265
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,210
That will make us equal.

266
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,330
And equal is one thing we're not.

267
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:32,940
A Pradhan is a Pradhan after all.

268
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,420
True.

269
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:42,430
We'll have to think of something
to get rid of his chair forever.

270
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,970
With your permission shall we..

271
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,160
No, no, no violent means.

272
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,760
Sir, pass me the phone.

273
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,250
Rascal, answer it yourself.

274
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,870
Yes. You think you can order
me around. Answer it yourself.

275
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:05,510
Who is it?

276
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,800
Yes, brother Parmeshwar.

277
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,750
Yes..

278
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,170
They are here.

279
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,110
Let's go. Let's go. They are here.

280
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,370
- Let's go.
- The wedding procession is here.

281
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,260
- Dab some on me as well.
- Here you go.

282
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,900
- Here as well.
- I did, I already did..

283
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,780
Let's go. Come on, let's go..

284
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,100
Should I give 51 rupees or 101?

285
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:27,360
Give whatever you have.
Doesn't matter whether it's 51 or 101.

286
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,070
Is brother Parmeshwar's
daughter's name Twinkle or Kareena?

287
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:45,940
- Please.
- No..

288
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,130
Thank you. I've had enough.

289
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,690
- Take some more.
- Have another glass.

290
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:50,820
Go on Vikas, pour him another glass.

291
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,410
- This is not fair.
- Don't be shy, brother.

292
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,220
Please, have it. You'll feel relaxed.

293
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,360
- Parmeshwar.
- Yes.

294
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,490
Are you going to serve only juice?
Bring some snacks.

295
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,220
Mr. Secretary has
gone to get the snacks.

296
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,200
He has still not returned.

297
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,530
- Since, when you are saying it!
- Son, his glass is empty.

298
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,430
- Put it.
- Speak of the devil and he's here.

299
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,700
- He is here.
- Serve the snacks to everyone. Come on.

300
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:11,770
- Give it.
- Vikas.

301
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,260
Tell them, we'll have snacks later.

302
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,600
We'll have snacks after some time.

303
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,540
What?

304
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,670
We'll have snacks after some time.

305
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,660
They must be tired. Carrying
all that ammunition, you know.

306
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,370
- Of course, son. Get some rest.
- Take your time.

307
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,320
- Sure, sure. - You've to go home
after a couple of hours.

308
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,410
Of course.

309
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:31,050
So we'll go to the school
where the guests are waiting.

310
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,550
That's where the elders are.
Let's go there.

311
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:37,530
Yeah, sure. Oh, yes, Son.
He's the Secretary.

312
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,850
He will be here.

313
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,830
If you need anything, just tell him.

314
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,380
Think of him the
bride's older brother.

315
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,320
He's a very decent man. Very nice.

316
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,390
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Okay, let's go.

317
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,390
We're leaving.

318
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,200
- Where are you going?
- The snacks are right here.

319
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,740
The wedding venue.

320
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,770
So tonight's the night..

321
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,690
- Not tonight.
- Then?

322
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:00,790
Tomorrow night.

323
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,860
I am sitting inside.
Call me if you need anything.

324
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,360
Of course.

325
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:11,090
I don't see your
sisters-in-law around.

326
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,720
No father, I am not worried.

327
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,360
Just a little stressed about work.

328
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,390
Listen. Can you serve the snacks?

329
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,760
Just a minute. I'll be right there.

330
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,540
No, it was just some guy.

331
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,720
I'll take care of that.

332
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,580
This is humiliating.

333
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,330
Who makes the groom
wait for the snacks?

334
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,080
Let him come.

335
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,460
I'll deal with him.

336
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,700
Keep the chairs outside.

337
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,990
We'll have the snacks outside.

338
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:03,650
Outside!

339
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,070
What's taking so long for the chairs?

340
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,390
Don't know will it
come now or in next year?

341
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,000
Here he comes.

342
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,120
Come on.

343
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,820
Wait, wait..

344
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,590
What is this?

345
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,470
What?

346
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,530
There are only five sweets.

347
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:42,020
- Five in mine too.
- Five in mine too.

348
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,250
Five here.

349
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,400
There were seven sweets
in all the boxes..

350
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,010
..that were distributed at the school.

351
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,920
But there's only five in mine.

352
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,550
And the main sweet with
the silver layer is missing.

353
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,950
I see..
Wait. I'll be back in two minutes.

354
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,310
Two minutes again?

355
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,300
Mr. Parmeshwar, I didn't know..

356
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,410
..that there are separate boxes
for the guests and the villagers.

357
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,670
I took whatever I
saw in the storeroom.

358
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,120
I am not coming over now.

359
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,470
Tell someone to send it over.
Someone must be free.

360
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,620
Fine. And hurry up
or they will start sulking.

361
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:22,770
The groom and his friends, who else.

362
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,210
The arrangements are pathetic.

363
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,710
I just had a word.
They are sending the other boxes.

364
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,430
You just have to wait for a while.

365
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,220
What is this?

366
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,560
Mr. Abhishek!

367
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,650
If we had to wait the least you could
do was give us a better chair to sit.

368
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,990
I noticed they have
a nice cushioned chair inside.

369
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,410
If you have a better chair inside..

370
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:03,380
..why did you give the groom
this plastic chair to sit on?

371
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,570
What?

372
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,690
Is this a joke? Tell me.

373
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,790
Does seem like a joke.

374
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,370
Kamlesh. Tear the plastic.

375
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,060
Don't take off the plastic.

376
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,730
What do you mean
don't tear the plastic?

377
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,680
- It's very uncomfortable.
- What uncomfortable?

378
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,870
Don't start it again.
The sound it's making is annoying.

379
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,620
So what if it's making a sound.

380
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:07,840
I said don't tear the plastic.
Don't you get it?

381
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,540
Such a pain in the neck.

382
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,010
This isn't some prop from
your wedding, this is personal.

383
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:14,670
If you like tearing
the plastic then do it..

384
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,900
..with the things
you'll get in the dowry.

385
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,920
Asshole.

386
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,620
What..

387
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,430
What did he call me?

388
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,370
Sounded like an asshole.

389
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:34,080
Check on your mobile.

390
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:39,890
What?

391
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,110
What?

392
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:47,020
Asshole means poop hole.

393
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,950
Call my father.

394
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,370
Uncle be careful.

395
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,820
If you didn't want this
wedding to take place..

396
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,180
..you could've intimated us earlier.

397
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:11,780
How can anyone call the groom
home and call him an asshole?

398
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:14,850
Does my son look like an asshole?

399
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,240
Tell me.

400
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,940
That's not what I meant.

401
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:23,000
You should check the meaning first.

402
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,380
It also means stupid.

403
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,590
That's what that Secretary meant.

404
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,300
He was just calling him stupid.

405
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,180
But why call the groom stupid as well?

406
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,150
I admit that it's wrong.

407
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,630
But the Secretary is pretty brazen.

408
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,290
He even called me stupid once.

409
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:43,120
- When?
- Shut up.

410
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,650
And what did you do?

411
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:47,080
I called him stupid as well.

412
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:52,570
Fine. Then Ganesh will
call him stupid as well.

413
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,890
Go on, son.

414
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,280
- Say it, son. Come on, say it.
- Come on, say it. Come on..

415
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,940
- Come on, say it to him.
- Come on son, say it. Come on.

416
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,230
Come on, say it son. Come on, say it.

417
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,610
No, father.

418
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:05,700
I won't call him stupid.
I will call him an asshole.

419
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,040
Doesn't matter. Go ahead.

420
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,780
- Yes, go on. Come on.
- Yes. Come on, say it.

421
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,620
- Don't be shy. Come on, say it.
- Say it out loud.

422
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,460
- Say it. Come on.
- Say it.

423
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,280
- Say it.
- Say it.

424
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,680
- Say it.
- Say it out loud.

425
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,860
- Say it out loud.
- Come on. Say it.

426
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,240
Say it. Come on, say it.

427
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,180
Asshole.

428
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,470
Abhishek is an asshole.

429
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,450
He's a complete asshole.

430
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:30,800
- He is an asshole.
- Asshole..

431
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,890
- Now be happy..
- Asshole..

432
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:35,350
- Happy..
- Come on, son. Come on.

433
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:36,970
- Okay. Everyone is happy now. Let's go.
- Let's go.

434
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:38,040
We're running out of auspicious time.

435
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,130
- Mr. Raghunath, come on. Let's go.
- Please, come.. Please..

436
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,870
Fine, let's go.

437
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,350
Wait, father.

438
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,590
I'll go.

439
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:51,820
But, I want his chair as well.

440
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,970
This one?

441
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,400
Yes.

442
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,240
Mr. Secretary, you upset the groom.

443
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,460
It's the least you
have to do to cajole him.

444
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,090
I'll have to go to the
market again and get a new chair.

445
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,270
Mr. Secretary, I am not so cruel.

446
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,110
You won't have to buy a new chair.

447
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:37,900
You can take my chair.
It's perfectly cushioned.

448
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:41,130
- But sir..
- You're taking my chair, final.

449
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,350
Then where will you sit?

450
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,680
- I will sit..
- Don't worry about him.

451
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,240
He will buy a new chair for himself.

452
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,480
He is very rich.

453
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,620
150 hectares of land, cows, imagine.

454
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,510
Yes. Okay, Mr. Secretary.
End of the story then.

455
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,980
See, they are coming.

456
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,320
Every chair has a lifespan.

457
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:50,210
It arrives seated on your head.

458
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:53,880
Later it lets you sit on it..

459
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,280
..or even leads to bloodshed. See.

460
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,450
Mr. Secretary, we've cold beers.
Come on.

461
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,670
What's Mr. Secretary doing here?

462
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:09,690
Sir, that chair looks
exactly like yours.

463
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,470
Isn't it?

464
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,450
Continue counting the bricks.

465
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:20,680
70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76..
