1
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,130
Hello! Yes, mother.

2
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,290
Yes, of course. It's already 11 o'clock.
I won't stay hungry till 11 o'clock.

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,900
The same old.

4
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,520
The same old bread jam, banana.

5
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,410
Yes, I drank milk.

6
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,070
Yes.

7
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,540
Why would I lie to you?

8
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,060
How do you know that
I don't buy milk every day?

9
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,260
Of course, I do.

10
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,360
But I already drank milk.
How can I send a picture to you now?

11
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,770
Yes, I did mother. I am very busy now.

12
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,780
I'll send you the picture tomorrow.

13
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,300
You can lie without blinking, sir.

14
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,780
You'll learn too when you
stay away from home. Let's go.

15
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,670
Don't be so mean, sir.
I just recently got married.

16
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,850
What is this?

17
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,720
[Indistinct chatter]

18
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,920
Here you go.

19
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,150
Do you have the keys?

20
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,320
- Yes, sir.
- What, sir?

21
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,870
Tell me Mr. Abhishek,
did you get the job done or not?

22
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,190
No, sir. I will get it done today.

23
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,250
You've been giving
excuses for a week now.

24
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,370
The DM keeps calling me every
week asking me for an update.

25
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:44,740
What do I tell her?

26
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,550
Look Mr. Abhishek,
if you don't get the job done today..

27
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,670
..then we'll have to take
disciplinary action against you today.

28
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,730
- Know this. - Not to worry, sir.
I'll get the job done today.

29
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,500
The painter has already arrived
on site. In fact, I am on my way..

30
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,740
Let's go.

31
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,100
Let's take the motorcycle.

32
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,060
It's nearby. Let's go.

33
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,330
Mr. Secretary,
do these slogans make any difference.

34
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,790
People have as many kids they want.

35
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,110
Isn't that right? Sir!

36
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,150
Well, we've put up the slogan now.

37
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,950
You see, Prahlad sir,
it's a government order.

38
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,080
Whether it makes a difference or not,
we'll have to get it written.

39
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,880
And these things do create
some awareness among people.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,170
Like you are, aren't you?

41
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,930
This is for newly married couples,
understand.

42
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,180
I've been quite aware since day one.

43
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,230
Let's move ahead. This looks fine.

44
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,140
We'll have to move one. Aware you say.

45
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,020
I'll show you how aware you are!

46
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,570
Come. Look here..

47
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,200
This is the place..
You can get things here.

48
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,040
No harm in taking a shower at
times, Madhav.

49
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,560
Uncle..

50
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,760
Pradhan sir,
I was thinking of buying milk.

51
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,070
Who do you think should I ask?

52
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,120
Why don't you ask Pradhan, sir?
He's got many cows and buffaloes.

53
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,570
Fine. Do you want
cow's milk or buffalo's?

54
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,960
Anything is okay.

55
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,540
You should buy buffalo's milk.

56
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,260
Buffalo's milk is denser.

57
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,890
He's from the city.

58
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,180
Might not be able
to digest dense milk.

59
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,260
He can always add water to it.
That will do the trick.

60
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,090
Fine then,
I'll take buffalo's milk then.

61
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:17,210
I've three types of buffaloes.

62
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,080
Murrah, Surthi, and Jaffrabadi.

63
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,080
- Which buffalo?
- Surthi will be fine.

64
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,340
I used to buy Surthi buffalo's milk
from you. That milk was good.

65
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,240
Jaffrabadi is even better.

66
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,210
Be quiet.

67
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,130
He's going to drink the milk, not you.

68
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,900
You know what.. Yes, hello.

69
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,390
My advice is you take Murrah.

70
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,570
- Fine, then Murrah it is.
- Okay, fine.

71
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,380
So, how much?

72
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,930
Half a litre is enough.

73
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,730
Damn it!
Who buys half a litre of milk?

74
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,980
You must buy at least
2 litres of milk.

75
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,500
Go to the gym, exercise, otherwise
you will never gain any weight.

76
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,060
No thank you, but half a litre will be
enough for me. How much for a month?

77
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,890
Why would I charge
you for half a litre milk?

78
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,660
But that's not right..

79
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,200
No, I've said it. I'll not take it.

80
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,530
- Pradhan sir.. - The Pradhan
is a rich man, Secretary sir.

81
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,090
- Yes, you.. - He's got property,
cows, what else would he want.

82
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,580
Yes, your father left it for me,
didn't he?

83
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,160
Nonsense.

84
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,640
This is the one.

85
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,020
What is this?

86
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,330
Where is the painter?

87
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,610
I am here, sir.

88
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,090
I was taking a leak.

89
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,400
What have you written?

90
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,930
"Two children are as sweet as pudding.."

91
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,940
"..more than that can
be painful like piles."

92
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,290
I didn't write it on my own.

93
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,070
I wrote exactly what Secretary
sir asked me to write.

94
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,420
This is what the BDO
office instructed us to write.

95
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,400
Pradhan sir..

96
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,050
..don't you think this going a little
overboard in the name of awareness.

97
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,330
What overboard? Looks fine to me.

98
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,380
Maybe a little over the top,
but it's fine.

99
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,940
Yes, Prahlad, It's fine. And anyway,
who reads all this in the village.

100
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,400
Okay, if you two think it's fine,
then it's fine.

101
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,960
I was just making a point.

102
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,200
So Mr. Secretary,
shall I send Banwari then.

103
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,800
He'll delivery half a litre
of milk every day at 7 am.

104
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,490
Fine. You guys go on,
I'll get this done.

105
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,920
Murrah buffalo's milk, right?

106
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,070
And also how much it
will cost me every month.

107
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,990
You're still stuck on the money.

108
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,580
I promised you, didn't I?
Forget about it.

109
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,740
- Come on.
- I'll go to the office.

110
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,010
- You said this will take
only one hour. - Yes, sir.

111
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,140
Finish it quickly.
Fill up on this side.

112
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,360
Doesn't look nice if I charge
him for half a litre of milk.

113
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,050
Of course, because you're so rich..

114
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:58,560
..that 750 rupees a month
doesn't make any difference to you.

115
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,620
In case you've stashed a
couple of million rupees somewhere..

116
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,430
..do let me know as well.

117
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,610
What nonsense are you talking?

118
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,250
Our daughter is old
enough to get married..

119
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,520
Hand me that.

120
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,370
But he doesn't get time
from boasting his wealth.

121
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,060
Yes.

122
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:16,590
Giving half a litre of milk every day
will cancel our daughter's wedding.

123
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,360
It's not about Rinky's wedding.

124
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,420
You have this bad habit.

125
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,200
Sometimes you give vegetables
for free, and sometimes milk.

126
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,790
Why don't you give
him the entire buffalo?

127
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,200
Why are you shouting?

128
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,070
I'll tell the Secretary to pay.

129
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,170
Happy?

130
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,470
What happy?

131
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,480
You're not doing me any favour.

132
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,690
Fine, then I won't ask.

133
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,790
I said I will ask him for money.

134
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,620
But I can't ask him right away.

135
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,790
I'll have to think of some way..
Like how, where.. when?

136
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:58,410
I just can't walk up to him
and demand the Secretary money.

137
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,390
I gave him my word.

138
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,930
Then tell him that you're a leader.

139
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,100
Your promises are fake. Tell him.

140
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,680
I am not that kind of a leader.

141
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,240
Then what kind are you?

142
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,890
This one.

143
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,490
Give me those dirty ones.

144
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,210
Come down to the office in a
couple of days and collect your money.

145
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,620
Okay sir.

146
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,080
What have you written, Secretary sir?

147
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,220
This..

148
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,060
These are official slogans.

149
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,080
What is this?

150
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,000
I didn't write it on my own.

151
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,540
I wrote exactly what Secretary
sir asked me to write.

152
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,600
What do you mean to say?

153
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,700
More than two children are like piles.

154
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,400
Pintu here is like piles.

155
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,350
"Pintu is like piles."

156
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,770
- "Pintu is like piles."
- Quiet.

157
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,280
Father, what does piles mean?

158
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,420
Nothing, son.
It means chocolate candy.

159
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,340
Secretary sir,
please get rid of these slogans.

160
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,860
Get rid of it.

161
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,270
I can't. These are official orders.

162
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,040
Fine. Now watch..

163
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,830
Vinod, people..

164
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,840
See what the Pradhan is trying to do.

165
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,100
What's wrong, Bhushan?

166
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,780
- You have four children, don't you?
- Yes, I do.

167
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,900
- According to them your third and
four children are piles. - What?

168
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:39,070
- I am not saying this, they are.
- Bhushan, don't make things worse.

169
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,620
This is just a whiff
of things to come.

170
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,590
Go and tell Pradhan sir..

171
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:47,200
..that he won't get a single vote
from my family in the next elections.

172
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,210
We have a big family.
And everyone has 3-4 children.

173
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,790
Even I won't vote for them.

174
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,390
Father, even I won't vote for them.

175
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,640
Absolutely right, son.
Don't vote for anyone.

176
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,780
Just wait till you turn 18.

177
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,630
I guess things are going to get worse,
Secretary sir.

178
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,620
Will I get my money?

179
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,990
Just clean up and leave.

180
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,030
- Vikas!
- Yes.

181
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,170
Get the slogans repainted.

182
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,620
Vikas..

183
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,970
Pradhan sir, we've official
orders to get the slogans written.

184
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,170
Even I am under a lot of pressure.

185
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,170
But, sir..

186
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,780
You see Mr. Secretary,
a lot of families in this village..

187
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,020
..have more than two children.

188
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,260
What if they all go against,
Pradhan sir?

189
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,190
What do I do, Prahlad sir?

190
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,960
If I don't follow the order,
then I'll face disciplinary action.

191
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,620
What action?

192
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,780
I can lose my job, Pradhan sir.

193
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,500
You will lose your job..

194
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,860
..but I might lose
my seat as the chief.

195
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,200
So what is more important?

196
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,670
Your job or my seat?

197
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:18,290
Sir, for him his job
must be more important.

198
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,420
Hello.

199
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,470
Yes Gajinder, tell me.

200
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,300
What are you saying?

201
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,460
What..

202
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:37,880
We're not calling your son piles.

203
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,790
This is different.

204
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,570
- Why..
- Why don't you understand?

205
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:45,780
No, no, it's not what you think. No..

206
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,440
Yes.

207
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,900
Gajinder has three brothers.

208
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,310
Meaning four votes.

209
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,760
And their wives.
Meaning eight votes from that family.

210
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,800
And Gajinder's father.

211
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,550
If he lives till the next election's,
that means one more.

212
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,010
You lost nine votes.

213
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:06,040
Mr. Secretary, please talk to the BDO sir.
Try to explain to him the situation.

214
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,400
Fine, I'll try.

215
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:16,270
Oh, God. Prahlad,
get all the slogans repainted.

216
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,290
Or else these people
won't stop calling.

217
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,950
Pradhan sir,
let it stay for the time being.

218
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,420
Why do you worry?

219
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,130
BDO sir will understand, won't he?

220
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:29,790
What do you think?

221
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,400
BDO sir won't understand?

222
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,770
Who are you giving this for free?

223
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:50,040
You're too much. Out of the way.

224
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,430
Wait.

225
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,880
Did you talk to the Secretary
about the money for the milk?

226
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,010
I will..

227
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:57,860
You're making my life
hell for 750 rupees.

228
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,060
- Come on, out of my way.
- No.

229
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,670
Why don't you donate everything we
have instead. Give away everything.

230
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,890
Trying to be over considerate.

231
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,600
Abhishek sir,
you please give this to BDO sir.

232
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,240
I am very nervous.

233
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:29,190
Whenever I try to talk to Pradhan sir,
he hands me this bottle gourd.

234
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,940
Bottle gourds are not
conversation starters.

235
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,480
What is this?

236
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,590
It's a bottle gourd.

237
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,370
Even I can see its not an eggplant.

238
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,240
Do you guys really feel you can get
your job done by giving me vegetables?

239
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,180
You think I am corrupt.

240
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,900
Pradhan sir isn't letting me write it.
What should I do?

241
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,710
Fine then,
why should I take the blame on me?

242
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,320
If DM madam asks..

243
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,410
..I'll tell her Phulera Panchayat's
secretary isn't fit to do the job.

244
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,230
Sir if you think I
am unable to explain them..

245
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,430
..then why don't
you try explaining him.

246
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,950
Why should I explain to him?

247
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,240
He's your chief. You explain to him.

248
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,450
- He's not my relative.
- He isn't my brother-in-law either.

249
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,190
Sir!

250
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,610
Sir! The villagers have
objection with the world "Piles".

251
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,000
So can we use something different..

252
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,670
How can you even say such a thing?

253
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,230
How can we change it?

254
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,950
We intentionally out that word there,
so people feel offended.

255
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,060
You guys just don't get it.

256
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,520
- Mr. Tiwari.
- Yes, sir.

257
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,120
Look!

258
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,480
DM madam is worried about the
growing population of our country.

259
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,440
So she believes..

260
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,960
"Two children are as sweet as pudding.."

261
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,530
"..more than that can
be painful like piles."

262
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,260
This slogan will touch people's heart.

263
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,620
So go and explain Pradhan sir.

264
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,800
And rewrite the slogans again.

265
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:05,360
Otherwise, DM madam will screw my ass,
along with the rest of you.

266
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,550
And what if Pradhan doesn't agree.

267
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,330
Then she will screw his ass too.

268
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,520
He's no different, is he?

269
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,890
I don't know.

270
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,840
Leave.

271
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,370
Leave it.

272
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,170
Pradhan sir let's
rewrite that slogan..

273
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:04,980
..otherwise the DM
will screw both our..

274
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:11,470
DM madam will take
disciplinary action on us.

275
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,620
Pradhan sir say something.

276
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,710
Go and study.

277
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,730
Then rewrite it. What's the big deal?

278
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,700
You will lose the next election.

279
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,730
So what if we do?

280
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:49,410
These people who are making
a big deal out of a slogan..

281
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:53,070
..tell them to go
and ask their wives..

282
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:57,240
..what it takes to give birth to more
than two children and raise them.

283
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:01,400
Fine, I agree that
"Piles" is not a nice word.

284
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,280
But the slogan is right.

285
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,470
Don't try to be a wise guy, I know.

286
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,420
Then why aren't you letting
the write the slogan?

287
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,710
Do the right thing.

288
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:12,290
A person never wins the elections
by just doing the right thing.

289
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,080
You know nothing about politics.

290
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,380
Why don't you say..

291
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,840
..that you don't have the
guts to take the difficult decision?

292
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,210
Come, lie down.

293
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,300
Don't talk nonsense.

294
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,820
You know nothing, and just blabbering.

295
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,150
You won't ask money from
the secretary for the milk..

296
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,820
..so he doesn't feel offended.

297
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,880
And even though the slogan's right,
you won't get it written..

298
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,060
..so the villagers don't get offended.

299
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:44,950
If you're so scared,
then do one thing..

300
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,540
Look at me.

301
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,570
Write my name under the slogan.
I said it.

302
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:54,790
And I will talk to the
Secretary for the milk money.

303
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,970
Can't even speak up
for the right thing..

304
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:59,810
..and you want to be a leader.

305
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,680
Disciplinary action might
mean suspension I guess.

306
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,010
How long would it be for?

307
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,100
How would I know for how long?

308
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,050
I'll find out when I get suspended.

309
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,170
Why don't you check the
Panchayat's HR policy? It might have...

310
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,230
Wait a minute.

311
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,000
Hello... Abhishek

312
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,290
Yes, sir.

313
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,660
Mr. Secretary, do one thing.

314
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,050
Call a meeting of all the
ward members tomorrow morning.

315
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:11,090
Look, all of you go and
tell the people in your ward..

316
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,290
..that we're all supporting the slogan

317
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:16,250
"Two children are as sweet as pudding.."

318
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:20,130
"..more than that can
be painful like piles."

319
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,520
And we're supporting this
slogan because it's absolutely right.

320
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,770
Pradhan sir.

321
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,880
Are you taking this decision
because of the pressure from DM madam?

322
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,180
No, this is my personal decision.

323
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:34,200
But sir, this can cause
trouble in the upcoming elections.

324
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,820
I don't care.

325
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,330
Not just for you, but for us too.

326
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,890
Yes, this can be
troublesome for us as well.

327
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:46,290
Look, if anyone asks then you can say
that this is my decision..

328
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,360
..and you have nothing to do with it.

329
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,290
That's fine.

330
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,590
That's fine, Pradhan sir.

331
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:52,570
As you say.

332
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:55,450
Listen, you can say
this is our decision.

333
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,750
The Chief and deputy chief.

334
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,320
Why are you poking your nose?

335
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,700
Not at all, Pradhan sir.
This is all about politics.

336
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,130
What if you lose and I win?

337
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,470
- Then that won't be fun at all.
- You're a rascal.

338
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,470
Sir, I am with you too.

339
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,690
I wasn't chosen by the elections.

340
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,670
But I am supporting Pradhan sir too.

341
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:15,790
Okay.

342
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:20,000
The rest of you have no
pressure for this responsibility.

343
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,800
Okay sir, as you say.

344
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,000
Okay, let's go then.

345
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,720
Wait.
Sit, sit.

346
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,690
Secretary sir, that thing
you explained to me yesterday..

347
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:33,620
On the cigarette box.

348
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,240
- Yes, right.
- Explain that as well.

349
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,800
Sit down. No need to stand up.
You're always so eager to stand up.

350
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,380
Now listen.

351
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,610
If anyone objects while you're explaining
them and they don't understand..

352
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,460
..then you can definitely
give them this example.

353
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,930
Just like the warning
message on cigarette packets..

354
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,850
..similarly, these slogans are
made this way to make you feel bad.

355
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,360
So that the right message
is conveyed to the people.

356
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,770
Did you all understand?

357
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:01,790
Explain it exactly the way
Secretary sir explained to all of you.

358
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,550
- We've understood.
- Okay?

359
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,500
Word by word,
exactly the way he said it.

360
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,820
- Okay.
- Yes' we've understood.

361
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,370
And Vikas,
get the slogans rewritten again.

362
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:12,450
Okay.

363
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,720
Okay then, let's go.

364
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,450
Yes.. do it.

365
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,580
[Indistinct chatter]

366
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,380
Secretary sir, you must be really happy.

367
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,520
You got what you wanted.

368
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:28,690
That's not true. Pradhan
sir's decision is absolutely right.

369
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:31,050
Forget it. Doesn't matter now.

370
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:34,410
Doing the right thing
has put our position at stake.

371
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,320
Isn't that right?

372
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,360
- BDO sir is calling.
- Put it on speaker.

373
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,730
Put it on speaker.

374
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,480
Yes, sir. Pradhan sir has agreed.

375
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,720
Congratulations.

376
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,350
Its great news that
Pradhan sir has agreed.

377
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:57,670
By the way Mr. Abhishek,
that slogan isn't mandatory right now.

378
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:01,150
Why? What happened?

379
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,150
Nothing special.

380
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,460
We just heard that some guy from the
neighbouring village who had six kids..

381
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:11,360
..read that slogan and got so furious
that he burnt the Panchayat office down.

382
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,150
So you guys see what's best to be done.

383
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,620
Hello.

384
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,240
What do we do, Pradhan sir?
Shall we stop them?

385
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,620
Of course, we should stop them.

386
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,730
Pradhan sir,
what if they burn this office down too.

387
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,740
I sleep here all alone.

388
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,310
Call them.
Call Vikas.

389
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,590
You just said we
took the right decision.

390
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,830
If the decision is right,
then why are you scared?

391
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,920
Pradhan sir, you're over motivated.
Think practically.

392
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,760
No one will lay a finger on the office.

393
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,810
Whatever they want to do, they
can do it to me in the next elections.

394
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:40,880
But..

395
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,950
And you'll have to pay 750
rupees every month for the milk.

396
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:44,530
Huh?

397
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:47,840
750 rupees.

398
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,510
It's a Murrah buffalo.
It needs to be fed.

399
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:57,160
Strangely, I am feeling
like Sardar Patel from inside.

400
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,790
Do you know Sardar Patel?

401
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,000
The Iron Man of India.

402
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:06,220
He never hesitated to take
the most difficult decisions for India.

403
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,210
I want to be like him someday.
